 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to document the build process of the Apache Guacamole
manual for technical users who wish to contribute or who simply wish to build
the manual themselves.

The latest version of the manual is provided on the Guacamole web site, and
snapshot copies of each release are included in the release archives:

    http://guacamole.apache.org/


------------------------------------------------------------
 What is guacamole-manual?
------------------------------------------------------------

The guacamole-manual package is the base documentation for the entire Guacamole
stack. It is written in reStructuredText, a plaintext markup syntax commonly
used for authoring manuals and technical documentation.

The build process involves running the Guacamole manual source through the
tooling provided by the Sphinx project, in particular "sphinx-build".


------------------------------------------------------------
 Building the manual
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Ensure Sphinx and the default ReadTheDocs theme are installed. These can be
   installed using "pip" via the "sphinx" and "sphinx_rtd_theme" packages
   respectively.

   https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/
   https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/

2) Run make

    $ make

    The manual will now be built using Sphinx. Once complete, the entire
    HTML version of the manual will be available within the "build/html"
    directory in the root directory of the source tree.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Building and viewing the manual using Docker
------------------------------------------------------------

The guacamole-manual package includes a Dockerfile that can be used to build 
an Apache httpd Docker image that contains the Guacamole user manual.

By building and running the resulting container, a developer can work on the 
user manual without the need to install Sphinx on their workstation. The
resulting container can also be used to serve the  manual to Guacamole users on
a network.

Docker CE version 1.6 or later is required to build the image.

Build the Guacamole manual container image by running the following command in
the directory that contains this Dockerfile:

    $ docker image build -t guacamole/manual .

Run the resulting container using the following command:

    $ docker container run -p 8080:80 guacamole/manual

You'll see some startup messages from Apache httpd on your terminal when you 
start up the container. Once the container is running you can then view the 
HTML version of the manual by accessing http://localhost:8080 using your web 
browser.

If another process on the host is already using port 8080, you will need to 
change the corresponding argument in the command used to start the container.

As a developer working on the documentation, it will be necessary to stop the
container and run the build again each time you wish to see changes you've 
made to the documentation source.
