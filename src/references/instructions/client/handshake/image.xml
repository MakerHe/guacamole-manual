    <para>Specifies which image mimetypes are supported by the client. Each parameter must be a
        single mimetype, listed in order of client preference, with the optimal mimetype being the
        first parameter.</para>
    <para>It is expected that the supported mimetypes will include at least "image/png" and
        "image/jpeg", and the server <emphasis>may</emphasis> safely assume that these mimetypes are
        supported, even if they are absent from the handshake.</para>
