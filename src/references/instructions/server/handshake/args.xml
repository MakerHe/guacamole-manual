    <title>args</title>
    <para>Reports the expected format of the argument list for the protocol
        requested by the client. This message can be sent by the server during
        the handshake phase only.</para>
    <para>The first parameter of this instruction will be the protocol version
        supported by the server.  This is used to negotiate protocol
        compatibility between the client and the server, with the highest
        supported protocol by both sides being chosen.  Versions of Guacamole
        prior to 1.1.0 do not support protocol version negotiation, and will
        silently ignore this instruction.</para>
    <para>The remaining parameters of the args instruction are the names of all
        connection parameters accepted by the server for the protocol selected
        by the client, in order. The client's responding connect instruction
        must contain the values of each of these parameters in the same order.
